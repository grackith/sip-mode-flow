# sip-mode-flow
Travel Behavioral Informatics-Dr. Joseph Chow-SP2024. The project frames mode choice as a result of surrounding built environment support. In response to rising VRU deaths in dense urban settings, and increased support for complete street designs, this project validates a national initiative, Vision Zero, and their SIP mitigation strategy.


# Components of project: There are three main components.

    1) Characterize the ITS system, its relevant variables, and their relationships with each other. Random variables need to be clearly identified and specified from data and/or assumptions so that Monte Carlo simulation needs can be identified.
    
    2) Behavior model. There needs to be a behavior model estimated from data. See Topic.
    
    3) Revenue management. There needs to be a component in which you specify an objective (e.g. improve profit, improve social welfare) and use the characterized system model, simulation tests, with behavioral model, to determine the outcome.

## Topic

The topic can involve any ITS with behavioral feedback, with a requirement that it be rooted in the NYC living lab environment. It can involve an existing ITS (e.g. public transit advanced traveler information system), or a new proposed ITS (e.g. a cargo bike delivery reservation app), and involve either an existing survey data set (e.g. Regional Household Travel Survey), or a new collected sample data set (e.g. surveying pedestrians in Washington Square Park to determine trip data)
